# Random Number Practice in C#

Create a list of random numbers. Using a for loop, determine if the current loop index is contained inside of the `numbers` list. Print a message to the console indicating whether the index is in the list.

## Example Output in the Terminal
numbers list contains 0
numbers list does not contain 1
numbers list does not contain 2
numbers list contains 3
